# My Personal Resume Website

This is the code for my personal resume website, built using HTML and CSS. You can use this as a template to create your own portfolio/resume website.

## How to View

1.  Download the files (`index.html` and `style.css`).
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Files

*   `index.html`: The main website content. **You can edit this file to add your own information.**
*   `style.css`: The website's styling.
*   `my-photo.jpg`: Your profile picture (replace this).

## How to Make Your Own Portfolio/Resume

2.  **Change the text:** Change the text inside the different sections (About Me, Experience, etc.) to your own information.
3.  **Change the photo:** Replace `my-photo.jpg` with your own photo and make sure it's in the same folder as `index.html`.
4.  **(Optional) Change the styling:** Open `style.css` in a text editor to change the colors, fonts, and layout.
